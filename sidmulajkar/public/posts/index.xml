      <description>What do I even mean by useless indexes?
 To improve the application and the database, indexes need to change over time.
As the structure of the database change, the structure of the tables change, data in the tables change, the application changes, also the queries against the data change.
Indexes that once helped performance now just bloat your database and cause extra work for inserts, updates, and deletes.

For the longest time, what we do is search the table one by one sequentially (page by page).</description>

Everyone claims to be faster than the competitors, but twenty times so? Can A2 Hosting live up to its promises? Letâ€™s take a look.
Speed Tests Donâ€™t Lie
When this company says itâ€™s 20x faster than its competitors, itâ€™s not just exaggerating to make an eye-catching headline.</description>

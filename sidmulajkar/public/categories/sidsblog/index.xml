      <description>Message queues &amp;hellip;ðŸ“¨ ðŸ“¨
What are those and when to use them?
The role of message queuing in a micro-service architecture.
When is the right time to use a message queue and why is a database rarely the best tool for a queue-based problem?
A blog on backend engineering&amp;hellip;
 Imagine that you have a web application for customers to upload a text document, which then converts it into a PDF, and then emails it back to the customer.</description>

      <description>What do I even mean by useless indexes?
 To improve the application and the database, indexes need to change over time.
As the structure of the database change, the structure of the tables change, data in the tables change, the application changes, also the queries against the data change.
Indexes that once helped performance now just bloat your database and cause extra work for inserts, updates, and deletes.

      <description>What are those? Ever used those while searching through the dataset.
How they are useful in databases?
 To understand stuff more clearly let&amp;rsquo;s take a scenario:
Like you have a table, a huge table(millions of rows to go through), and you want to search to a particular numbered row by some id mentioned &amp;ldquo;100035&amp;rdquo; and not only pulling a row but getting most out of the pulled row.
For the longest time, what we do is search the table one by one sequentially (page by page).</description>

      <description>Database ShardingHow often do you shard your database?

Your database is now becoming a bottleneck for the rest of your application. Database sharding could be the solution to your problems.

      <description>Does it affect Web Application Performance?
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a feature, not an issue but can be a problem sometimes while analyzing and designing the app.
 TCP slow start is a congestion-avoidance algorithm that balances the speed of a network connection.
A slow start gradually increases the amount of data transmitted until it finds the networkâ€™s maximum carrying capacity.
One of the most common ways to optimize the speed of a connection (i.</description>

      <description>Requirements Computer, virtual private server (VPS) or dedicated server running Debian based server instance. Linux or macOS computer for following the steps and hardening the server Guide Step 1. Create the SSH key pair for login (On Computer) Using a root login password to login is good but not great from the security stand.
When asked for file in which to save key, enter serverlog.
When asked for passphrase, use output from openssl rand -base64 24 (and store passphrase in password manager).</description>

      <description>How to Handle the Double booking problem in an app or website just using the database?
Well the Answer is :
It totally depends, on what use, we are using the concurrency model for using the specific database to avoid this problem.
Firstly, what the heck is double booking problem? An online movie ticket booking system provides its customers with the ability to book movie tickets online. BookMyShow as an example allows the customers to browse movies currently being running in a city and to book seats, anywhere anytime for a show.</description>

      <description>Choosing the Best Database? Whether you are an experienced software engineer or a student doing a university project, at some point we will need to choose a DB for our project.
Choosing the right kind of database always requires some consideration.
&amp;ndash;
First of all, databases will not impact our functional requirements. Whichever database we use can still achieve our functional requirements somehow, but at the cost of huge performance degradation.</description>

The role of message queuing in a micro-service architecture.

When is the right time to use a message queue and why is a database rarely the best tool for a queue-based problem? A blog on backend engineering&amp;hellip;
Imagine that we have a web application for customers to upload a text document, which then converts it into a PDF, and then emails it back to the customer.</description>

      <guid>https://sidmulajkar.com/posts/when-indexes-are-not-useable/</guid>
      <description>What do I even mean by useless indexes? To improve the application and the database, indexes need to change over time.
As the structure of the database change, the structure of the tables change, data in the tables change, the application changes, also the queries against the data change.
Indexes that once helped performance now just bloat your database and cause extra work for inserts, updates, and deletes.

      <description>What are those? Ever used those while searching through the dataset. How they are useful in databases?
To understand stuff more clearly let&amp;rsquo;s take a scenario:
Like we have a table, a huge table(millions of rows to go through), and we want to search to a particular numbered row by some id mentioned &amp;ldquo;100035&amp;rdquo; and not only pulling a row but getting most out of the pulled row.

      <description>Once youâ€™ve decided to shard your database, the next thing you need to figure out is how youâ€™ll go about doing so. Your application suddenly becomes popular. Traffic and data are starting to grow, and your database gets more overloaded every day.
People on the internet tell you to scale your database by sharding, but you donâ€™t know what it means.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the last blog post and want to know more about Database Sharding check the previous blog &amp;gt; What is Database Sharding</description>

      <description>How often do you shard your database? Do you prematurely shard? Do you actually need that for your database?ðŸ¤” &amp;ndash;
Your application is growing. It has more active users, more features, and generates more data every day.
Your database is now becoming a bottleneck for the rest of your application. Database sharding could be the solution to your problems.
But Wait&amp;hellip; Q) What is Database Sharding? Sharding is a method for distributing a single dataset across multiple databases, which can then be stored on multiple machines.</description>

      <description>TCP and UDP A simple open-ended question that can test whole schemas of knowledge.
What will be addressed in this post? The problem with packets (IP)
TCP pros and cons
TCP communication sample code
UDP pros and cons
UDP communication sample code
Some questions based on them
To start, I was asked a question in an interview,
What to use UDP or TCP in Building a Backend Application?
I was like why only these 2 protocols, there are many others, like HTTP, HTTP2, XMPP, GRPC, QUIC</description>

      <description>Does it affect Web Application Performance? Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a feature, not an issue but can be a problem sometimes while analyzing and designing the app.
TCP slow start is a congestion-avoidance algorithm that balances the speed of a network connection.
A slow start gradually increases the amount of data transmitted until it finds the networkâ€™s maximum carrying capacity.
One of the most common ways to optimize the speed of a connection (i.</description>

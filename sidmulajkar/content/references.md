# Documentaries/Talks

- [Glenn Greenwald’s TED Talk on Privacy](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters). It’s only about 15 mins long and a must-watch.

- [Data Privacy and Consent TED Talk by Fred Cate](https://www.ted.com/talks/fred_cate_privacy_and_consent). Dr. Fred Cate’s talk revolves around the current approach to data privacy. He analyzes the role that consent plays, in data protection and privacy today, grappling with how we manage consent in a world in which data is constantly being inferred about us.

- [The Great Hack (Netflix)](https://www.netflix.com/Title/80117542). Another must-see documentary that explains how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook to seriously influence voters in the 2016 US election, Brexit in the UK, and many other elections around the globe.

- [ANON (Netflix)](https://www.netflix.com/Title/80195964). As a dystopian sci-fi movie, it’s so-so; but it serves as an insightful criticism of ubiquitous facial recognition systems.

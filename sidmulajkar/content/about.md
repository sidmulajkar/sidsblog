"I have no **special talents**. I am only **passionately curious**."

Ever since i saw the computer at my friend's house, computers have been my passion. This inspiring zeal carried me through my education at DMCE (not IIT or NIITðŸ˜‰)... getting the bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, learnt new things and started my career **freelancing** to starting a **startup**, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as kid.

**Founder** of Tech Sid Solutions, which helped new aspiring entrepreneur's make a digital presence marking their first footprint. There's certainly yet more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I'm very obliged.

**Currently Working on Technologies**: React, SwiftUI, Node, Python, Machine Learning, Flutter(Beginner)

Contriver by heart ðŸ’š, developer by profession..

"I have no **special talents**. I am only **passionately curious**."

Ever since I saw the computer at my friend's house, computers have been my passion. This inspiring zeal carried me through my education at DMCE, getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, learned new things, and started my career **freelancing** to starting a **startup**, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid.

**Founder** of Tech Sid Solutions, helped new aspiring entrepreneurs make a digital presence marking their first footprint. 

**Consultant** for **Startups**, and have helped to launch new mini-products, **Brand building**, Retention Marketing.

**Currently Working on Technologies**: **Devops**, React, SwiftUI, Node, Python, Machine Learning, Flutter(Beginner)

Highly Interested in **Blockchain Technology** and recently started exploring Ethereum Dapps Development.

There's unequivocally yet more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I'm very obliged.


**Contriver** by heart ðŸ’š, **developer** by profession.

"I have no **special talents**. I am only **passionately curious**."

Ever since i saw the computer at my friend's house, computers have been my passion. This inspiring zeal carried me through my education at DMCE getting the bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, learnt new things and started my career **freelancing** to starting a **startup**, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as kid.

**Founder** of Tech Sid Solutions, which helped new aspiring entrepreneur's make a digital presence marking their first footprint.

**Currently Working on Technologies**: **Devops**, React, SwiftUI, Node, Python, Machine Learning, Flutter(Beginner)

There's certainly yet more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I'm very obliged.


**Contriver** by heart 💚, **developer** by profession.

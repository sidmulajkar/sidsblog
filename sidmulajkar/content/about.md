**Currently Working on**: **c++**, Javascript, **Cyber Security Research & Privacy Guides**, Machine Learning, SwiftUI, Node(Beginner), React(Beginner)

**Security Tools**: BurpSuite, Metasploit, Wireshark, OWASP-ZAP(Beginner)

There's unequivocally yet more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I'm very obliged.

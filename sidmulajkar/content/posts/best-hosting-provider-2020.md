At first glance, **A2 Hosting** might seem like nothing more than another hosting platform that sings high praises then falls flat on the delivery. The features almost seem too good to be true.

**Everyone claims to be faster than the competitors, but twenty times so? Can A2 Hosting live up to its promises? Let’s take a look.**


**Speed Tests Don’t Lie**
When this company says it’s **20x faster** than its **competitors**, it’s not just exaggerating to make an eye-catching headline. A2 Hosting has a special set of optimizations, and this clean code really makes things quick. There’s no laggy, outdated programming on these servers. Premium plan members are also placed in a less crowded environment, which really helps to facilitate faster speeds.

And while nothing beats raw speed and power, there are other features to back it up. Shared hosting is what most bloggers are after, and these unassuming plans pack quite a punch. You can choose between Linux or Windows, the latter of which costs a bit more.

Still, most or all Linux features are there. A free SSL certificate is included, which you’ll need before you can process transactions, so it’s a huge save.
